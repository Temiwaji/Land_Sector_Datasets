**#### 1. Introduction**

**Purpose of the Documentation:** This user documentation aims to provide users with the knowledge and guidance needed to interpret integrated data related to land sector information and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It also outlines the usage of the visualization tool to gain insights from the data.

**Prerequisites:**  Before proceeding, users should have a basic understanding of geospatial data and the concepts of SDGs. Users will also need a performant desktop machine or laptop with sufficient storage and RAM for pre-processing global open-source datasets, as spatial datasets can be memory-intensive.

**#### 2. Interpreting Integrated Data**

The Land Sector Data integrates various datasets related to land use, environmental impact, and social implications. These datasets are aligned with specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). You can explore and analyze the data to gain insights into how land attributes contribute to sustainability objectives.

**Understanding the Data:** The Land Sector Data is an array of datasets relevant to land use, environmental impact, and social implications. These datasets are meticulously aligned with specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). You can navigate through these datasets and analyze them to extract valuable insights into how land attributes contribute to sustainability objectives.

**Mapping Attributes to SDGs:** This features an ingenious mapping mechanism that expertly links dataset attributes to specific SDG goals and targets. This mapping is founded on thorough research and data analysis to establish meaningful connections.

**Visualizing Land Data-SDG Relationships:** Craft a wide range of visualizations that impeccably represent the intricate relationships between land attributes and SDGs. These visualizations empower you to grasp how land use patterns align with the broader sustainability objectives.

**#### Using the Visualization Tool**

**Selecting Datasets:** Make a selection of from the available datasets. Opt for the datasets that align perfectly with your research or the area of interest you wish to explore.

**Customizing Visualizations:**  You can shape visualizations to suit your specific research questions and objectives. You can choose to be flexible by creating maps, charts, graphs, and much more at your discretion.

**Visual Interpretations:** Gain a visual understanding of integrated data and its implications by uncovering insights and key findings from the data analysis.

**Saving and Exporting Visualizations:** Once you have successfully crafted your visualizations, you can conveniently save or export them for future reference. This is particularly useful when you wish to incorporate these visualizations into your research reports or presentations.

**#### 4. User Support**

**Troubleshooting:** In the event that you encounter any challenges or issues while using the tool, a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) has been provided within the documentation. Here, you will find solutions to common problems, ensuring a smooth user experience. If you encounter an issue that persists, do not hesitate to reach out to the support team.
